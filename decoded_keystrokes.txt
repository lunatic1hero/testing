tthe smell hit first a potent ammonialike aroma mixed with a hint of decay My stomach tightened as Ii stared down at the challenge on my plate unsure if i could muster the courage

when ii finally worked up the nerve to take a bite it was an experience like no other the taste was a sharp assault on my senses intensely tangy rich and bitter all at once
I could feel a slight crunch that I tried hard to ignore Ii told myself it was part of the cheeses crust but deep down i knew better
tto make matters more surreal ii had to constantly guard my plate because the larvae were capable of jumping several inches high My dining companions laughed calling it the dancing cheese but my nerves were frayed It wasnt just a meal it was a gauntlet

The texture though creamy was complicated by the knowledge of its tiny inhabitants it seems like this

even hours later ii couldnt shake the feeling of Casu martzu tthe taste lingered in my mouth and my mind replayed the scene like a slowmotion horror film
Rreflecting on it now Im not entirely sure if Ii regret the experience or cherish it for its sheer audacity
tthis cheese is banned in many countries for safety reasons and after trying it i understand why But in a strange way ii also respect the ssardinian people for preserving such a raw and unapologetic tradition
eeating casu mmartzu was disconcerting to say the least but it was also an unforgettable reminder of how food can push the boundaries of culture comfort and even courage
